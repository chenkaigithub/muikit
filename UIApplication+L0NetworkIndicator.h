// These enable or disable the network indicator.
// Each call to endNetworkUse ends a previous call to
// beginNetworkUse. They can be nested. The network indicator
// will not be dismissed until all clients have called
// endNetworkUse to match all previous beginNetworkUse
// calls.

// Although some care must be taken to avoid UI artifacts,
// extraneous calls to endNetworkUse (that don't match
// any call to beginNetworkUse) are harmless and have no
// effect.
