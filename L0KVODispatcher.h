#if DEBUG

/* DEBUG FACILITIES.
 KVO is hairy and brittle and opaque and I shouldn't really have based a product around it so yeah.
 L0KVODispatcher provides some debugging facilities to help fixing KVO trouble, especially someone-is-still-observing-on-dealloc KVO trouble.
 These facilities are disabled by default. To enable:
 
  - Make sure the copy of MuiKit you're linking to has the preprocessor directive DEBUG=1 set -- this happens automatically if you embed MuiKit by referencing the project and you use the Debug build style.
  - Do the following:
   * Set the @"L0KVODispatcherShouldKeepTrackOfObservers" user defaults key to YES (via setBool:forKey: or similar).
   AND/OR
   * Start the app with the L0KVODispatcherShouldKeepTrackOfObservers environment variable set to YES.
 
 Using the facilities yields arbitrary behavior if they're not on as specified above. Do not do that.
 
 So, if KVO says object 0x1234 is being still observed during its dealloc, just break on NSKVODeallocateBreak(), then issue a
	
	(gdb) po [L0KVODispatcher observersOfObject:(id) 0x1234]

 to see who's looking where they shouldn't. There, much better.
